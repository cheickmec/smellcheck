# Python Refactoring Skill

83 refactoring patterns from Contieri's series, Fowler's catalog, OO metrics literature, and Python idioms.

## Modes

**Active Analysis** (default when given code): Identify smells -> map to patterns -> load relevant references -> apply refactorings with before/after -> note trade-offs.

**Reference Lookup** (when asked about a pattern by number/name): Load the relevant reference file -> present the pattern.

## Automated Smell Detector

`scripts/detect_smells.py` runs the smell detector with 56 automated checks (41 per-file + 10 cross-file + 5 OO metrics). It ships with a bundled copy of the smellcheck package — no pip install required.

```bash
# Works immediately after skill install — no pip required
python3 scripts/detect_smells.py src/
python3 scripts/detect_smells.py myfile.py --format json

# Look up rule documentation (description + before/after example)
python3 scripts/detect_smells.py --explain SC701
python3 scripts/detect_smells.py --explain SC4    # list a family
python3 scripts/detect_smells.py --explain all    # list all rules

# Caching (enabled by default — skips unchanged files on repeat scans)
python3 scripts/detect_smells.py src/ --no-cache       # fresh scan
python3 scripts/detect_smells.py --clear-cache         # purge cache

# Or use the pip-installed CLI directly
pip install smellcheck
smellcheck src/ --min-severity warning --fail-on warning
```

**Cross-file detections** (10): SC606 duplicate functions (AST-normalized hashing), SC503 cyclic imports (DFS), SC504 god modules, SC211 feature envy, SC505 shotgun surgery, SC308 deep inheritance, SC309 wide hierarchy, SC506 inappropriate intimacy, SC507 speculative generality, SC508 unstable dependency.

**OO metrics** (5): SC801 lack of cohesion, SC802 coupling between objects, SC803 fan-out, SC804 response for class, SC805 middle man.

Run the detector first for a quick scan, then use the reference files to understand and apply the suggested refactorings.

## Guided Refactoring Workflow

smellcheck groups its 56 rules into 9 ordered phases with dependency chains. The `--plan` command generates a customized refactoring plan based on actual findings.

### Initialization

```bash
smellcheck <path> --plan                  # text overview
smellcheck <path> --plan --format json    # machine-readable
```

The plan auto-selects a strategy: **local_first** (default, phases 0-8) or **architecture_first** (reorders to [0,1,7,8,2,3,4,5,6]) when >30% of findings are cross-file or metric scoped.

### Phase Execution Loop

Each phase has three passes:

**Pass 1 — Automated scan**: Run the `--select` command printed in the plan output for the current phase. Fix each finding using the reference file for that rule's family.

**Pass 2 — Agent semantic review**: For candidate files (files with automated findings + changed files in branch + import neighbors for cross-file phases), check for manual patterns assigned to the current phase. Evidence requirements for every semantic finding:
- File path and line range
- Actual code snippet
- Pattern number and name
- Why it matches the heuristic
- Confidence score (>=0.8 auto-fix, 0.5-0.79 suggest+confirm, <0.5 don't emit)

**Pass 3 — Gate check**: If gate is `tests_pass`, run the test suite and do not proceed until green. If `rescan_after` is true, re-run `--plan` and re-bucket.

### Manual Pattern Assignments per Phase

| Phase | Patterns | Agent detection heuristics |
|-------|----------|---------------------------|
| 0 correctness | (none) | Fully automated |
| 1 dead_code | 005 | Comments that restate the next line — delete them |
| 2 clarity | 011, 031 | 011: comments explaining "what" not "why". 031: error messages missing context |
| 3 idioms | 059, 060 | 059: `list(gen)` where result is only iterated once. 060: single `isinstance()` dispatch |
| 4 control_flow | 043, 046, 047, 049, 053, 056 | 043: expression >80 chars with no named subparts. 046: loop body with 2+ concerns. 047: function that parses+computes+formats. 049: manual impl of stdlib op. 053: related lines separated by unrelated. 056: if/elif 4+ branches |
| 5 functions | 010, 020, 027, 037, 050, 052 | 020: function-scoped import. 027: `obj.get_x()` + logic → move to obj. 037: test accessing `._private`. 050: two functions >80% body similarity. 052: 3+ related params |
| 6 state_class | 012, 019, 022, 023, 030, 038, 044, 048 | 012: dict with 3+ consistent keys → dataclass. 019/044: primitive with constraints → value object. 022: siblings with duplicate methods. 023: inheritance for reuse not "is-a". 030: cached attr that drifts. 038: `list[str]` with domain meaning. 048: unclear constructor → factory |
| 7 architecture | 015, 025, 035, 045 | 015: `if x is not None` in 3+ sites → Null Object. 025: regex >80 chars → `re.VERBOSE`. 035: same exception for biz+infra. 045: broad input without precondition |
| 8 metrics | (none) | Fully automated; use results to revisit phase 6 |

**Pattern 032** (inconsistent formatting): Tool-enforced — run `black` or `ruff format` before starting workflow.

### Conditional Branching

- No classes detected → phases 6 and 8 skip automatically
- No async code (SC703 has 0 findings) → skip in phase 3
- Architecture-dominant (>30% cross-file) → plan reorders to architecture-first
- Single-file scan → cross-file phases will naturally have 0 findings
- Large backlog → generate baseline, gate only new findings

### Feedback Loops

- Phase 8 → Phase 6: under `local_first`, if metrics still high, loop back (max 2 iterations). Under `architecture_first`, phase 8 runs before phase 6, so this becomes forward flow — metrics inform the class design pass.
- Phase 5 → Phase 8: extraction changes cohesion, re-check metrics
- Any phase → tests: if tests break, pause and fix first

### Completion Criteria

All phases either skip (0 findings) or pass. Tests green. Feedback loops converged. `smellcheck --plan` shows all phases as skip.

## Guidelines

- Prioritize structural refactorings over cosmetic
- Preserve existing tests -- refactoring changes structure, not behavior
- Group related changes when multiple patterns apply
- Flag changes to public API (breaking vs non-breaking)
- For large code, suggest incremental order rather than all-at-once
- When patterns conflict, explain the trade-off and recommend
