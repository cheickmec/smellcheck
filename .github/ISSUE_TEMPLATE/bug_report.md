**Describe the bug**
A clear description of what went wrong.

**Python code that triggers the issue**
```python
# Paste the minimal code that reproduces the problem
```

**Expected behavior**
What should smellcheck report (or not report)?

**Actual behavior**
What does smellcheck actually output? Paste the relevant output:
```
# smellcheck output here
```

**Environment**
- smellcheck version: (`smellcheck --version`)
- Python version: (`python --version`)
- OS:
- Install method: pip / GitHub Action / pre-commit / Agent Skills

**Additional context**
- Is this a false positive (reported something that isn't a smell)?
- Is this a false negative (missed a smell that should be detected)?
- Is this a crash or unexpected error?
